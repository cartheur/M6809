# Experiments around the 6x09 CPU

New development work with the Motorola 6809 and Hitachi 6309 8-bit CPU for novelty. Multicomputing is the trajectory.

## Building a multicomuter experimental station around the `x09` architecture.

This is for a kit that uses Motorola 6809 as CPU. It has a UART chip added, an 6850 ACIA. The circuit is as simple as possible, so uses a small number of components. All decoder logic is placed in a PLD chip. This makes the circuit is very easy to build. 

It uses a `cc09` c-compiler for 6809. The monitor was developed using c and assembly code. The main clock frequency is 4.9152MHz. UART chip uses E clock, 4.9152MHz/4 as the TXD/RXD clock. The prescaler is 64, so the UART will produce 19,200 bit/s rate.

The 6809 has long branch using a 16-bit offset. One of the monitor key provides 16-bit HEX calculator, so it is elementary to find the 8-bit or 16-bit offset. Programming comes in two contexts:

* For assembly (`asm`) coding, one can use hex key to enter and test the program.
* For language-construct (`c`) programming, one can use UART for `s19`-file uploading.

## Hardware description

* U5 is the Motorola 6809 CPU. The 4.9152MHz is generated by onchip oscillator with internal frequency 1.228MHz for CPU operations. NMI, HALT, IRQ, FIRQ are pull-up to logic 1 with R2. Only E and R/W and A0,A1, A10-A15 are used for memory decoding.
* U1 is 32kB EPROM, 27C256. The address space for EPROM is decoded at 0xC000-0xFFFF.
* U2 is 32kB static RAM, 62256. The RAM space is located at 0x0000-0x7FFF. Zero page is located at 0x0000-0x00FF. User program can be tested from address 0x0200.
* U4, memory and I/O spaces decoder chip is made with GAL16V8D. It provides chip selected signals for memory and I/O chips.
* U3, the 20-pin 89C2051 microcontroller chip produces 10ms tick. SW1 selects between 10ms tick or manual IRQ button.
* U6 is 6850 ACIA, UART. The shift clock is derived from E clock, 1,228,800Hz. Internal prescaler is 64. Thus the bit rate will be 19,200 bit/s.
* U12, 74HC541 is 8-bit input port (PORT0). Six bits, PA0-PA5 are input signals of the row keypad.
* U10, 74HC573 is 8-bit output port (PORT2). The 8-bit output drives the 7-segment LED directly. No current limit resistor. U11 (PORT1) drives 6-digit common cathode pin. The brightness is controlled by software controlled PWM. PC7 is speaker output for beep signal.
* U13, 74HC573 is 8-bit output port for 8-bit binary number display. D13 lifts the forward biasing for proper brightness. JR1 is 16-pin socket for text LCD interface. U14, HIN232 converts TTL level to RS232 level.
* Q2, KIA7042 is reset chip for power brownout.

### Test code

![An example](/images/test-code.png)

Simple program that writes accumulator content to `gpio1` LED at `$8000`. It will show 8-bit binary counting. `Delay1` is small delay subroutine that uses `X` register. One can enter the hex code into memory and test run directly.

Can you change the speed to run faster?

Another example of using 10ms tick generator for counting binary at 1Hz rate. Change SW1 to 10ms tick.

![Tick-generator example](/images/tick-generator.png)

The IRQ vector in ROM is pointed to new location in RAM at `$7FF0`. Students can modify where to put IRQ service routine. Above example uses location `$6000` for IRQ service. The main code then inserts JMP to IRQ service instruction, `7E 60 00` to location `7FF0`. Then clear `I` flag and wait for interrupt.

The IRQ service uses location `0` for tick counting. When it reaches `100`, clear it and increment location `1`. We can see 1Hz rate counting of location `1` by sending it to `gpio1` LED at location `8000`.

Can you change from 1Hz to 10Hz counting rate?
